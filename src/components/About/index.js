      <p>
        My name is Mason Marinko, I am a Husband to 1 and Father to 3. I believe
        a website should be much like a handshake, or a first impression. It
        invites people to get to know your business at a glance. I would love to
        make sure your first impression and website gives the right message and
        helps you grow your business! Contact me today!
